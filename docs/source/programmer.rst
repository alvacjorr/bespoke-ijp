Programmer's Documentation
==========================

The code for this project is split into two parts - Python code for the GUI and C++ embedded code for the uSteppers.
When navigating this code, it is strongly recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the C++, Python, Git and Arduino extensions.

In addition, this documentation is assembled using sphinx and ReadTheDocs.com.


Embedded 
*********

The core of the embedded firmware is loosely based on a GCode parser included with the uStepper's examples, but extended and upgraded to include more commands.


GUI Code
********

The classes, modules and functions that make this software work are all documented in the Python Module Guide.
This section is intended instead as a loose overview of the way the GUI operates.

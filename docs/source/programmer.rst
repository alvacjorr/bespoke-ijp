Programmer's Documentation
==========================

The code for this project is split into two parts - Python code for the GUI and C++ embedded code for the uSteppers.
When navigating this code, it is strongly recommended to use Visual Studio Code with the C++, Python, Git and Arduino extensions.

In addition, this documentation is assembled using sphinx and ReadTheDocs.com.

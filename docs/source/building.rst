===================================

The following instructions are advice only, and are followed at the reader's risk.

Parts List
**********

This system is almost entirely made of off-the-shelf or 3D-printed parts.

Note: this is not exhaustive!

- An optical table
- A comedically large quantity of 
- 2x `OpenBuilds C-Beam Linear Actuator <https://ooznest.co.uk/product/c-beam-linear-actuator>`_

  - Actuator Length 250mm
  - NEMA23 Stepper Motor
  - XL Gantry Plate
  - No C-Beam Motor Standoff
  - uStepper S Controller Board

- A power supply (3A, 24V) for the motors
- Probably a 3D printer! To make extra bits with...
- A Windows computer to install the software on (Linux compatability is in the works)
- A programmable power supply for the heater beds
- An inkjet nozzle system (MicroFab or equivalent)
- An optical observation system (highspeed camera, polarised filters, microscope lens or similar)


Assembling the rails
*******************

OpenBuilds have an instruction set for this. Pictures also on their way!


Downloading the software
************************

As in previous sections!


Registering the X and Y axes
****************************

To distinguish between the X and Y rails, simply specifying a COM or tty port can result in guesswork.
To simplify this process, I made a python script for this.

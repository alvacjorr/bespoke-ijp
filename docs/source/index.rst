Welcome
=========

This manual is for the Bespoke IEB Inkjet Printing (IJP) rig, a collaborative project between the `Fluid Dynamics Lab <http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/fluidlab>`_ and `Soft Matter Photonics <http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/smp>`_ groups in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science.
Currently the person responsible for building and maintaining this rig is Andrew Orr. It builds on work done by Ellis Parry.


This documentation will (eventually) include, amongst other things:

- Instructions on how to build this system from scratch
- Instructions on how to upload the firmware to the microcontrollers
- A User's Guide
- A Programmer's documentation for the Python GUI

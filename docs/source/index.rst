IEB Bespoke Inkjet Printing
=======================================


This manual is for the Bespoke IEB Inkjet Printing (IJP) rig, a collaborative project between the `Fluid Dynamics Lab <http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/fluidlab>`_ and `Soft Matter Photonics <http://www2.eng.ox.ac.uk/smp>`_ groups in the Oxford University Department of Engineering Science.
Currently the person responsible for building and maintaining this rig is Andrew Orr.

This documentation will (eventually) include, amongst other things:

- Instructions on how to build this system from scratch
- Instructions on how to upload the firmware to the microcontrollers
- A User's Guide
- A Programmer's documentation for the Python GUI
